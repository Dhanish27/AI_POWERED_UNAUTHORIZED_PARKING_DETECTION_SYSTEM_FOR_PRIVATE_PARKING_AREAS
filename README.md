# AI_POWERED_UNAUTHORIZED_PARKING_DETECTION_SYSTEM_FOR_PRIVATE_PARKING_AREAS

The "AI Powered Unauthorized Parking Detection System for Private Parking Areas" is designed to prevent unauthorized vehicle parking by integrating computer vision, RFID technology, and automated alert mechanisms. A fixed camera captures live footage of the parking area, which is processed by a Raspberry Pi running a pre trained YOLO v8 model to detect vehicles. If a vehicle is detected, the system verifies the presence and authenticity of an RFID tag. Authorized vehicles are allowed to park, while unauthorized vehicles either missing an RFID tag or having an unregistered one trigger an automated speaker warning and a notification to the parking owner or manager. This detection and verification process runs every 10 seconds to ensure real time monitoring. The proposed system enhances security, reduces manual intervention, and provides a proactive approach to managing private parking spaces efficiently.
